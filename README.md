# Bitextor MT Models

This repository contains all you need to train models used for bitextor
training in the HPLT project.

# Structure
Configuration files are stored per language pair, i.e. the top level of this directory is a bunch of language pair directories.

Configuration files could include:

- OPUS-filter configurations
- OPUS-cleaner configurations (per dataset)
- bergamot pipeline configurations
- Just notes about which OPUS model you're distilling, using which datasets.
